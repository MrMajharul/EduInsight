## 🏗️ System Architecture

The application utilizes a clean, modern decoupled client-server architecture:

1. **Frontend**: React (Vite) styled with **Tailwind CSS v4** and **Lucide Icons** implementing a premium, glassmorphism-based dark theme dashboard.
2. **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) hosting asynchronous REST endpoints and orchestrating individual LLM agent prompts.
3. **AI Reasoning**: Dynamic, structured prompt engineering powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash** to enforce strict JSON schemas matching frontend UI requirements natively.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* **Python**: `python3.10` or higher
* **Node.js**: `node18` or higher
* **Package Management**: `uv` (recommended for speed) or standard `pip`, and `npm`

---

### 1. Backend Setup

1. Change directory to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Set up and activate a clean virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Using uv (highly recommended)
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   
   # Using standard python
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install the required Python environments:
   ```bash
   # Using uv
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Using pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Configure your environmental credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Open `.env` and configure your API key access:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```
5. Spin up the FastAPI local development server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```
   The backend logic will open live at `http://localhost:8000`. Interact with structural endpoints via the Swagger ecosystem at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

---

### 2. Frontend Setup

1. Head into the frontend architecture directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Seed the node infrastructure modules:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Launch your local Vite client application workspace:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open up `http://localhost:5173` inside your modern web browser to interact with your agent network locally.

---

## 🧪 Running Automated Tests

A comprehensive integration test suite is included in the backend repository layer to ensure model formatting adheres flawlessly to incoming JSON payloads.

Execute tests via:
```bash
cd backend
PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest
```

## 🌍 Cloud Production Deployment Guide

### Backend Deployment (Render / Engine)
1. Push your updated code structure out to a private/public GitHub repository.
2. Enter your [Render Management Console](https://render.com/) dashboard and construct a new **Web Service**.
3. Link your designated code repository and pick the **Python** stack.
4. Input the following **Build Command**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Input the following **Start Command**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
   ```
6. Add your secret elements in the **Environment Variables** manager block:
   * `GEMINI_API_KEY` = *[Your Gemini Key Secret]*
   * `ENV` = `production`

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
The client layer is pre-optimized for structural deployment to Vercel. Connect your repository to Vercel, and it will auto-detect Vite's build configurations seamlessly.

#### 💡 Demo Mode Support
The application features an integrated **Demo Mode**. If no custom backend server or API key is declared, the frontend seamlessly transitions to local mock-generation engines. This allows evaluators, judges, and users to explore all core analytical capabilities completely client-side without spinning up external cloud server integrations.

## 🛡️ Security Features

* **Client-Side Key Encryption**: Dynamic keys provided through the in-app **Settings** module are retained inside client-side `localStorage` wrappers and transferred explicitly over encrypted TLS paths via request headers.
* **Robust Failback Architecture**: If client endpoints fail to reach downstream API endpoints, UI mechanisms gracefully step down to localized high-fidelity contextual data models, guaranteeing zero downtime.
